title: Hello GitHub world!
---

This is my very first post. After months (or maybe years) of procrastination I decided to make an effort and bring my GitHub page to life. Enjoy!

My posts here will basically be ideas poped out of my head (so expect not something coherent), or something interesting I ran into, which I modified for my own comprehension. The purpose of this is to collect stuff that I find useful, so I can run back on them when needed. However, I will be glad if people find it interesting; though this is not my goal.

So "Hello world"!
