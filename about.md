Currently, I work as a <b>Bioinformatician</b> at <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/">SciLifeLab</a> (<a href="https://ki.se/start">Karolinska Institute</a>), in Stockholm.

I acquired my MSc in <b>Bioinformatics</b> from <a href="https://www.uu.se/en">Uppsala University</a>, in 2016. Before that, I obtained my BSc in <b>Informatics</b> from the <a href="http://www.teiste.gr/">Technological Institute of Central Greece</a>, in 2013.

My favourite programming language is <b>Python</b>; it was love with the first touch. As a bioinformatician I also use a lot of <b>shell scripting</b> and sometimes <b>R</b>. On my personal projects I mostly use <b>Python</b>, <b>C/C++</b> and rarely <b>Javascript</b>. For my deep learning projects I almost exclusively use <b>TensorFlow</b>.

In my free time I like exploring new <b>AI</b> architectures & techniques. When I feel like changing scenes, I enjoy playing with <b>electronics</b> (from designing and soldering circuits - to programming), <b>networks</b>, <b>databases</b>, etc. Usually, I accompany such projects with some sort of <b>DIY crafting</b>.

The term <b>experience collector</b> describes me best; suggest something new and I'm in. Regularly I play <b>football</b>, go <b>bouldering</b> and <b>dancing</b>. I enjoy watching <b>Formula 1</b> and a wide variety of educational material. Lastly, I'm committed to <b>traveling</b>. I love how eye opening is to explore the world, learn history on sight and meet new cultures.
