## Raw facts

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-briefcase" aria-hidden="true"></i>
I am a Bioinformatician, working at [SciLifeLab] ([Karolinska Institute]), in Stockholm.
  </li><br>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i>
I acquired my MSc in Bioinformatics from Uppsala University, in 2016. Before that, I obtained my BSc in Informatics from the Technological Institute of Central Greece, in 2013.
  </li><br>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-terminal" aria-hidden="true"></i> My favourite programming language is Python. It was love with the first touch. As a bioinformatician I also use a lot of shell scripting and sometimes R. In my personal projects I mostly use Python, C/C++ and rarely Javascript. For deep learning projects I use TensorFlow.

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true"></i>
In my free time I like exploring new AI architectures & techniques. When I feel like changing scenes, I enjoy playing with electronics (from designing and soldering circuits - to programming), networks, databases, etc. Usually, I accompany such projects with some sort of DIY crafting.

Since then, I had a strong feeling that Machine Learning and Deep Learning will be the next big thing. I also had a drive towards data analysis and a passion on putting my hands in dealing with actual issues.

When I presented my ambitions to my bachelor thesis supervisor, [Dr. Dimitris Iakovidis], I was grateful that he presented me with a few great project ideas. I ended up using Complex Event Processing and training a k-NN algorithm to detect multi-signal patterns on EEG data (thesis written in greek; title translates to _"R&D of multi-channel signal analysis methods for knowledge mining"_).

Fast forward to my master's thesis, I was much more educated and hyped by the new advances, so I decided to test the ground on Deep Learning. Under the supervision of [Mikael Huss], one of the most charismatic individuals I've met, I implemented and trained a Neural Network to identify different cell types existed in single cell transcriptomic data. The project title is _"[Data-driven definition of cell types based on single-cell gene expression data]"_.

### More Information
I am a Machine Learning / Deep Learning enthousiast, so I enjoy thinking about biological solutions in terms of ML/DL. For my master thesis, I developed a Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder algorithm in order to classify (and potentially identify new) cell types (using human & mouse cortex, single cell gene expression data). You can find the code lying somewhere in my repos[.]
