As a child I had an immense curiosity about virtually everything.

Since then, I had a strong feeling that Machine Learning and Deep Learning will be the next big thing. I also had a drive towards data analysis and a passion on putting my hands in dealing with actual issues.

When I presented my ambitions to my bachelor thesis supervisor, [Dr. Dimitris Iakovidis], I was grateful that he presented me with a few great project ideas. I ended up using Complex Event Processing and training a k-NN algorithm to detect multi-signal patterns on EEG data (thesis written in greek; title translates to _"R&D of multi-channel signal analysis methods for knowledge mining"_).

Fast forward to my master's thesis, I was much more educated and hyped by the new advances, so I decided to test the ground on Deep Learning. Under the supervision of [Mikael Huss], one of the most charismatic individuals I've met, I implemented and trained a Neural Network to identify different cell types existed in single cell transcriptomic data. The project title is _"[Data-driven definition of cell types based on single-cell gene expression data]"_.

### More Information
I am a Machine Learning / Deep Learning enthousiast, so I enjoy thinking about biological solutions in terms of ML/DL. For my master thesis, I developed a Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder algorithm in order to classify (and potentially identify new) cell types (using human & mouse cortex, single cell gene expression data). You can find the code lying somewhere in my repos[.]
